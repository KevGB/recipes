## Recipe Website for the Odin Project

This is a super simple website for a collection of recipes. These are recipes for nutritious, yet easy and (usually) quick dishes I can make for myself so that I can spend more time studying The Odin Project, and less time in the kitchen. Literally made this as a meal guide for myself.

I'll continue to make it look better, because right now it's pretty funky, but I added a bit of CSS styling just for fun.
